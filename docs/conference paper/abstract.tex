      \par\textit{Abstract}  -- Researching soundscape ecology requires a large amount of data in the form of sound files. Sound files demand both digital space and processing power to analyze and draw conclusions from them. Mangrove provides a free and open-source software suite that simplifies the job of organizing and analyzing audio recordings of natural soundscapes using existing algorithms in the field of soundscape ecology. The results of these algorithms are used to create interactive data visualizations. Using these visualizations, researchers are able to come to conclusions regarding their research points, all while providing visual representations of these conclusions.
