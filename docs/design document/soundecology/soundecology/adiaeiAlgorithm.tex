\subsubsection{ADI and AEI Algorithm}
As ADI and AEI are closely related, their outputs are mostly the same, just tailored to the respective index. Along with the actual ADI or AEI value, the algorithms also output the ADI or AEI value for each band range, which is not included natively for AEI in the R package, and is included in the Proposed Changes section. These values include the ADI or AEI value at each frequency range, which can be specified by the user when creating jobs. Using these outputs, the ADI and AEI charts are able to be made.
