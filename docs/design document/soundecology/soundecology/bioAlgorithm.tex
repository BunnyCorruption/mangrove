\subsubsection{Bioacoustic Index Algorithm}
For the Bioacoustic index, the outputs for this service also include the left and right values, as well as the left and right normalized values for each frequency range. This is different than the base \codesnip{soundecology} package, and these changes are explained in the Proposed Changes section. For more information on how the Bioacoustic index is calculated, see the Overview of Indices section.
