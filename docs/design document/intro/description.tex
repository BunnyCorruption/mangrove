\subsection{Project Description}
Mangrove is a free and open-source software suite that simplifies the job of analyzing audio recordings of natural soundscapes using existing algorithms from the field of soundscape ecology. It offers both a back end server that processes the audio recordings and stores the results of their analysis, and a front end client that uses these results to generate interactive data visualizations. In turn, the data generated by the server and the visualizations generated by the client can be used by soundscape ecologists in the publication of their research.\par
The existing algorithms in question, Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Bioacoustic Index (BI), and Root Mean Square (RMS) can be compared side by side using our program to see the effectiveness and underlying meaning behind the data. This program will allow researches to draw conclusions from the indices as well as create correlations between the indices themselves. This will allow for rapid and efficient analysis of various data sets.\par
Mangrove\textquotesingle s objective is to advance the field of soundscape ecology as a whole for those interested and involved in research.\par
