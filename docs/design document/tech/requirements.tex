\subsection{Specification of Requirements}
The following requirements describe the full list of goals that need to be met. These goals will ensure a robust project that will assist our sponsor in analyzing data and allow other researchers to share their findings. Note that this section does not include stretch goals.\\\\
The core requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a user interface for data analysis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Create a catalog to organize user sound files and results
    \item Create an interface for uploading user sound files
    \item Create an interface for creating jobs to process sound files
    \item Allow user to queue jobs for sound file analysis
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use existing algorithms to turn audio recordings into data visualizations
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create at least one meaningful graph per index
      \item Create one graph for comparing data across time and data site for each index
      \item Create tool for analysis and visualization of multiple datasets compared over site and/or series
    \end{itemize}
  \item Include the following six indices and their parameters for analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI)
      \item Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI)
      \item Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI)
      \item Bioacoustic Index (BI)
      \item Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI)
      \item Root Mean Square (RMS)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Allow users to input their own parameters to be used in index calculation
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Include parameter presets for each index based on R package given values
    \end{itemize}
  \item Include an option to download the data being used by the visualizations in CSV format
  \item Create a tool for identifying and examining outliers in data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Identify which sound file from data set contained outliers
      \item Provide time marks for potential outliers
      \item Allow user to play specific audio files from data visualizations
      \item Include tool to allow user to listen to specific files in dataset
    \end{itemize}
  \item Implement secure access rights from user access information
\end{itemize}
