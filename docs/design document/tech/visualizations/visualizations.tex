\subsection{Data Visualization Research \& Design}
With the field of soundscape ecology being a relatively new one, the format of data visualizations is not yet cemented in the community. In addition to the basic functionality of analyzing sound data for metrics, another goal of this project is to research and define useful visualizations for both researchers and data consumers. Each index provides a different method of analyzing natural soundscapes, so not all forms of data representations will apply to each. The goal of this section is to shed light on the reasoning behind the decisions to use each index\textquotesingle s respective visualization in the service.
