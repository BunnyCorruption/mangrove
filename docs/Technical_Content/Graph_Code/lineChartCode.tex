\subsubsection{Line Charts}

\begin{htmlcode}
<LineChart width={900} height={600} data={data} >
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3"/>
  <XAxis dataKey="name" label={xLabel}/>
  <YAxis label={yLabel}/>
  <Legend />
  <Tooltip/>
  <Line type='natural' dataKey={firstDataKey}
                      stroke='#8884d8'
                      dot={false} />
  <Line type='natural' dataKey={secondDataKey}
                      stroke='#82ca9d'
                      dot={false} />
  <Brush />
</ LineChart>
\end{htmlcode}

The code above is used for creating the line charts seen in the NDSI, ACI, and Bioacoustic index, as well as the line charts for evaluating outliers. This flexibility is allowed as we can pass the label names and data key parameters through the components depending on which index was chosen.\par

\begin{htmlcode}
<ReferenceLine y={adiLeft} label="ADI Left" stroke="#433eaf"/>
\end{htmlcode}

For the ADI and AEI indices, a reference line is included as well, which is elaborated on more in the Data Visualization Research section of this paper.
