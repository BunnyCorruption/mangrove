\subsubsection{Catalog Page Specifications}
The catalog page is where the user can view their already processed data stored in the backend. If this user is using a shared server, this can potentially also show processed data from \textit{other} users in their group, should those permissions be allowed.\par
The catalog page will be depicted in two separate views, the first involving searching, filtering and selecting jobs and the second, viewing visualizations for the results of the selected jobs. The core functionality of the first view is as follows:\\

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Job Searching}\\ The user can search for jobs by site name or tags, which the user can apply to one or many jobs. This feature is helpful if the user wishes to compare results of sound files taken in the same location.
    \item \textbf{Filter By Index}\\ This section consists of a set of checkboxes for each index. They will all be selected when this page is loaded, so that all jobs will be shown to the user at first. Users can uncheck indices as they wish, so that only jobs which were run with checked indices will be listed.
    \item \textbf{Filter By Parameters}\\ This is where a user can specify the parameters used for the jobs which they would like to view analysis. Only parameters for checked indices will be displayed. An example of the usefulness of this feature is when a researcher would like to compare results analyzed within certain frequency ranges.
    \item \textbf{Sorting By Date}\\ Jobs matching the criteria set by the user in the previous sections will be listed with the most recently analyzed jobs shown first. However, the user will be able to show the oldest jobs first or input a specific date range.
    \item \textbf{Filtered Jobs}\\ This is where all jobs matching the filtering and searching done my the user will be listed.
    \item \textbf{View Results}\\ When the user finds the job they would like to visualize, they will click the 'view results' button next to that job. This will open the analysis view of the catalog page and the searching and filtering section will be hidden to allow more room for visualizations.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Show Filtering Section}\\ If the user wishes to redefine their specifications for the job list, this button can be clicked and will open the previous view.
    \item \textbf{Filtered Jobs}\\ The list of jobs matching the search and filtering specifications set by the user will still be displayed in this view. This section will only take up some of the room on the page and will make the next feature described much easier for users.
    \item \textbf{Compare}\\ If another job of the same index is shown in the filtered job list, the user can click the compare button next to the job. This will overlay both results on the same graph, a feature which will be very useful to researchers.
    \item \textbf{Graph Type Selection}\\ Depending on the parameters and index that was processed, different visualizations will be available. All graphs available for the current index will be listed in this section with radio buttons and the user can select their preferred graph or switch between views.
    \item \textbf{Clear Job}\\ This button can be clicked if the user is finsished viewing the current jobs visualizations. The filtering section will be opened again so a new job can be quickly chosen.
    \item \textbf{View Results}\\ This is where the analysis from the job is shown. Depending on the parameters and index that was processed, different visualizations will be available. If multiple jobs are selected, then a visualization comparing them will be shown.
