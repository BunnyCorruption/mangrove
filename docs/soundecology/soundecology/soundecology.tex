\subsection{The \codesnip{soundecology} R Package}
The \codesnip{soundecology} R package was developed by Luis Villanueva. This package contains algorithms for calculating the major indices, along with some extra abilities. Most importantly, the \codesnip{soundecology} package includes parameters for indices to split files up into smaller pieces for processing, helping to solve the problems outlined in the Benchmarking section. Obviously, each algorithm outputs the index value, however each also outputs specific values, value lists, and matrices that are also used heavily in this service for creating the visualizations.
