\paragraph{Phase 0 - Requirement Gathering and Initial Design} \mbox{}\\[\paragraphheaderspace]
The first milestone in this section, gathering requirements has been completed throughout various meetings with our team, sponsor, TAs and professor. Discussions with our sponsor have clarified what it means for our project to be successful and determined which features should be considered stretch goals. In meeting with our professor, the importance attempting to implement stretch goal features has been discussed. Are team has agreed on pursuing machine learning stretch goals and we have allocated time for this as shown in the milestones section.\par
The aspects of project design, including the database, API/backend and frontend have been through various iterations and have continued to improve throughout the first semester. A more detailed account of this process can be found in the design iterations section of this document. We have settled on most major design decisions at this time, but will continue to implement design improvements in the second semester if they arise.\par
