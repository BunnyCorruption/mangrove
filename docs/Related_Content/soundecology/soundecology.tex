\subsection{Soundecology R Package Research}
The \codesnip{soundecology} R package was developed by Luis Villanueva. This package contains algorithms for calculating the major indices, along with some extra abilities. Obviously, each algorithm outputs the index value, however each also outputs specific values, value lists, and matrices that are also used heavily in this service for creating the visualizations.
