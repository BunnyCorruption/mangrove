\subsubsection{NDSI Algorithm}
The core NDSI algorithm that comes with the soundecology package outputs everything needed for this service, so no changes are needed. Those outputs include the NDSI values for both channels, as well as the biophony and anthrophony for both channels. These values are used for the visualizations, expanded upon in the Data Visualizations Research section.
