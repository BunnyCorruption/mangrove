\subsubsection{ACI Algorithm}
The ACI algorithm outputs more useful information than most of the other algorithms. In addition to the base ACI value, it outputs an ACI value by minute, which is a bit better for representation of the ACI, especially for longer files. It also outputs a list of ACI values for each bin, which all sum up to the total ACI value. This list is useful for creating the line graphs included in this service. More information on the ACI index can be found in the Overview of Indices section.
