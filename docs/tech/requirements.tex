\subsection{Specification of Requirements}
The following requirements describe the full list of goals that need to be met. These goals will ensure a robust project that will assist our sponsor in analyzing data and allow other researchers to share their findings. Note that this section does not include stretch goals.\\\\
The core requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a user interface for data analysis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allow user to queue jobs for sound file analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Allow up to four jobs to queue for processing
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use existing algorithms to turn audio recordings into data visualizations
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Create at least one graph per index
      \item Create one line plot per job queued
      \item Create one graph for comparing data across time and data sites
      \item Include one choropleth map for visualizing data
      \item Include one spectrogram for each job queued
      \item Create tool for analysis and visualization of multiple datasets compared over time and site
    \end{itemize}
  \item Include the following six indices and their parameters for analysis
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI)
      \item Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI)
      \item Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI)
      \item Bioacoustic Index (BI)
      \item Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI)
      \item Root Mean Square (RMS)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Allow users to input their own parameters to be used in index calculation
  \item Include parameter presets for each index based on sponsor given values
  \item Create a tool for identifying and examining outliers in data
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Identify which sound file from data set contained outliers
      \item Provide time marks for outliers
      \item Create a tool for examining specific audio files from data visualizations
      \item Include tool to allow user to listen to specific file in dataset
    \end{itemize}
  \item Create collaborative abilities for researchers
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Allow user to join or create a research team
      \item Allow user to invite other users to a research team
      \item Allow research groups to share data and research to other teams
      \item Create crowd sourced data visualizations from sites and research teams
      \item Allow users to access other users\textquotesingle cloud-hosted sound files
      \item Allow users to provide access to cloud storage
    \end{itemize}
  \item Implement secure access rights from user access information
\end{itemize}
