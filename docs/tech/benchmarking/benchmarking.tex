\subsection{Benchmarking}
The process of analyzing the sound files in the field of soundscape ecology is quite painful as it stands. Currently, our sponsor uses wav format sound files of size 1.29GB, each a recording of sixty minutes long. Some datasets used include over one hundred sound files, which amounts to over 100GB of sound files to process. It is important to know the length of time needed to process these files locally based on the end user\textquotesingle s hardware. The following are the results of NDSI index analysis on a single sound file of size 1.29GB, and the respective hardware involved. In addition, results for file splicing are included as results of this research. As a side note, it seems important to add that in order to run analysis on sound files in R, each wav file must be converted to a Wave object in R to be used in the index processes. This alone has proven to be a lengthy process on lower end systems.\\
