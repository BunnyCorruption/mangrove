### Design Documentation
To compile this LaTeX document, you will need to run the following commands:
```
$ cd docs
$ pdflatex -shell-escape main.tex
```

If this is your first time compiling, or, if you've added more citations to `references.bib`, you'll then need to run Biber and recompile:
```
$ biber main
$ pdflatex -shell-escape main.tex
```

Once the latter compile finishes, you can find the resulting PDF: `main.pdf`.
