\subsection{Project Description}
A free and open-source user interface that simplifies the job of analyzing audio recordings of natural soundscapes using existing algorithms in the field of soundscape ecology. The results of these algorithms would be used to create interactive data visualizations, including graphs, maps and spectrograms. In addition to these visualizations, machine listening will potentially be utilized in the identification of and differentiation between natural and manmade sounds in the audio recordings. Using this artificial intelligence technique we will attempt to highlight sounds of interest within sound files collected by researchers.\par
The existing algorithms in question, Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Bioacoustic Index (BI), and Root Mean Square (RMS) can be compared side by side using our program to see the effectiveness and underlying meaning behind the data. This program will draw conclusions from these indices as well as create correlations between them. This will allow for rapid and efficient analyzation of  different data sets. The objective of this software is to advance the field of soundscape ecology as a whole for those involved in research and those consuming the analysis.\par
